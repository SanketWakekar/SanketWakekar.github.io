            <h2 style="color: darkblue;">About UIDAI</h2>
            <p>The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is a statutory authority established under the
                provisions of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services)
                Act, 2016 (“Aadhaar Act 2016”) on 12 July 2016 by the Government of India, under the Ministry of
                Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The Aadhaar Act 2016 has been amended by the Aadhaar and
                Other Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 (14 of 2019) w.e.f. 25.07.2019.

                Prior to its establishment as a statutory authority, UIDAI was functioning as an attached office of the
                then Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) vide its Gazette Notification No.-A-43011/02/2009-Admn.I)
                dated 28th January, 2009. Later, on 12 September 2015, the Government revised the Allocation of Business
                Rules to attach the UIDAI to the Department of Electronics & Information Technology (DeitY) of the then
                Ministry of Communications and Information Technology.

                UIDAI was created with the objective to issue Unique Identification numbers (UID), named as "Aadhaar",
                to all residents of India. The UID had to be (a) robust enough to eliminate duplicate and fake
                identities, and (b) verifiable and authenticable in an easy, cost-effective way. The first UID number
                was issued on 29 September 2010 to a resident of Nandurbar, Maharashtra. The Authority has so far issued
                more than 124 crore Aadhaar numbers to the residents of India.

                Under the Aadhaar Act 2016, UIDAI is responsible for Aadhaar enrolment and authentication, including
                operation and management of all stages of Aadhaar life cycle, developing the policy, procedure and
                system for issuing Aadhaar numbers to individuals and perform authentication and the security of
                identity information and authentication records of individuals.
