            <p>
                Does linking my bank account, PAN, and other services with Aadhaar make me vulnerable?
            </p>
            <p>No. As your bank information is not shared by the bank with anyone else, no one can have information
                about your bank account just by knowing your Aadhaar number. Also, UIDAI or any entity for that matter
                would not have any information about your bank account. For example, you give your mobile number at
                various places and to various authorities such as bank, passport authorities, income tax departments,
                etc. Would the telecom company have access to your bank information, income tax returns, etc.? Obviously
                no! Similarly, when you provide Aadhaar number to various service providers, your detail remains with
                the respective service providers and no single entity including the Government or UIDAI will have access
                to your personal information spread across various service providers.</p>
